added new route handle for visa api: 

https://github.com/nyu-csci-ua-0467-001-002-fall-2024/final-project-ShahramChaudhry/blob/master/routes/visaRoutes.js 
Added countrycode.json that is a json file with country codes, and when user enters country in destination, it is converted to country codes, backend fetches visa requirements correctly from the API, as reflected by console statements
but the issue is with frontend. I have been trying to fix it but might need assistance so I am thinking of coming to office hours.
